**Onyx** is the **Trust Registry and KYB (Know Your Business) service** for the [Open Checkout Network (OCN)](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/ocn-common).

## Phase 2 â€” Explainability

ðŸš§ **Currently in development** - Phase 2 focuses on AI-powered explainability and human-readable trust decision reasoning.

- **Status**: Active development on `phase-2-explainability` branch
- **Features**: LLM integration, explainability API endpoints, decision audit trails
- **Issue Tracker**: [Phase 2 Issues](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/onyx/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aphase-2)
- **Timeline**: Weeks 4-8 of OCN development roadmap

Onyx provides centralized trust management, business verification, and compliance checking capabilities for the OCN ecosystem. Onyx maintains allowlists and denylists, performs business verification checks, and provides APIs for trust verification across all OCN services.

## OCN Ecosystem

This service is part of the Open Checkout Network (OCN) - a decentralized payment infrastructure. Learn more about the OCN ecosystem:

- [OCN Common](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/ocn-common) - Shared schemas and utilities
- [Orca](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/orca) - Core decision engine
- [Weave](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/weave) - Audit and treasury receipts
- [Okra](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/okra) - Credit services
- [Opal](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/opal) - Wallet and virtual cards

## Quickstart (â‰¤ 60s)

Get up and running with Onyx Trust Registry in under a minute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/onyx.git
cd onyx

# Setup everything (venv, deps, pre-commit hooks)
make setup

# Run tests to verify everything works
make test

# Start the service
make run
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

The service will be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Test the trust registry:

```bash
# List all trusted providers
curl http://localhost:8000/trust/providers

# Check if a provider is allowed
curl http://localhost:8000/trust/allowed/trusted_bank_001

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Additional Makefile Targets

```bash
make lint        # Run code quality checks
make fmt         # Format code with black/ruff
make clean       # Remove virtual environment and cache
make help        # Show all available targets
```

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup over the Makefile:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Start the service
uvicorn onyx.api:app --reload
```

## Trust Registry Configuration

The Trust Registry can be configured using a YAML file:

```bash
# Copy sample configuration
cp config/trust_registry.sample.yaml config/trust_registry.yaml

# Customize the provider allowlist
# Edit config/trust_registry.yaml to add your trusted providers
```

**Built-in Providers** (fallback when no config file):
- `trusted_bank_001`, `verified_credit_union_002`, `authorized_fintech_003`
- `certified_payment_processor_004`, `licensed_lender_005`

See [docs/trust_registry.md](docs/trust_registry.md) for detailed configuration guide.

## Development

This project uses:
- **FastAPI** for the web framework
- **pytest** for testing
- **ruff** and **black** for code formatting
- **mypy** for type checking

## Phase 3 â€” Negotiation & Live Fee Bidding

Trust signals shape rail preferences through ML-powered risk assessment and rail weight adjustments.

### Phase 3 â€” Negotiation & Live Fee Bidding
- [x] **Feeds trust signals into negotiation** (e.g., high-risk â†’ disfavor ACH)
- [x] **Emits trust signal CE** (`ocn.onyx.trust_signal.v1`)
- [x] **Tests validating trust-influenced outcomes**

### Trust Signal Features
- **ML-Powered Scoring**: Trust score (0-1) based on device reputation, velocity, IP risk, and history length
- **Rail Weight Adjustments**: Automatic adjustment of payment rail preferences based on risk level
- **CloudEvent Emission**: Emits `ocn.onyx.trust_signal.v1` events for audit and integration
- **LLM Explanations**: Optional LLM-powered explanations for trust decisions
- **Deterministic Results**: Consistent scoring with configurable seeds for testing

### Trust Signal API Endpoints
- `POST /trust/signal` - Generate trust signal with ML scoring and rail adjustments
- `GET /trust/signal/status` - Get trust signal service status and capabilities
- `GET /trust/signal/sample-context` - Get sample trust context for testing

### MCP Trust Signal Verb
- `getTrustSignal` - Generate trust signal via Model Context Protocol

#### Trust Signal Request Example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/trust/signal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "trace_id": "trust-trace-001",
    "context": {
